<p><font size="4"> Originally, I am from New Hampshire and I spend most of my time here at UMaine playing soccer and studying. On this website I will show a couple of moves and the techniques on how to do them. The three moves I will walk through are the maradona, cruyff turn, and the step over. These three moves are very effective for offenders to use in soccer against defenders. Through practice one can perfect these techniques and better themselves over all as a player.</font></p>
