<p><font size="4"> Originally, I am from New Hampshire and I spend most of my time here at UMaine playing soccer and studying. On this website I will show a couple of moves and the techniques on how to do them. The three moves I will walk through are the maradona, cruyff turn, and the step over. These three moves are very effective for offenders to use in soccer against defenders. Through practice one can perfect these techniques and better themselves over all as a player.</font></p>

<p><font size="6" color="white">This move is a really simple technique and yet it looks super cool on the field.It was originally performed by the player Johan Cruyff. It is done when the offender is dribbling with the ball with a defender flanking them. The offender takes the inside foot and plants it while taking the ball and dragging it back behind the standing leg, turning, and sprinting away.

<p><font size="6" color="white">This move is simple yet effective. It has been perfected by many world class players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi, and Robinho.You don't even need to touch the ball! You simply move your foot around the ball while leaning one way to give the impression that you are going one way but in reality you are going the other. Then at the last second you tap the ball in the opposite direction you are leaning and accelerate away.
